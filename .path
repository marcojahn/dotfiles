#All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'.

#If you really need to use these commands with their normal names, you
#can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:

#PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

export PATH=$PATH:~/Development/adt/sdk/tools
export PATH=$PATH:~/Development/adt/sdk/platform-tools

#Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
#the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:

#MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"

#For non-homebrew python (2.x), you need to amend your PYTHONPATH like so:
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
